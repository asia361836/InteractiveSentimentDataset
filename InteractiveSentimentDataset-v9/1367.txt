A : Hi Alice. Do you know anyone who wants a dog? 0
B : What kind of dog? Yours? 0
A : Yeah. We have to give our dog away. 0
B : Why? You love Buster. 1
A : I know. But we just discovered that our son is allergic to dogs. -1
B : Really? 0
A : Yeah, he sneezes and gets a rash every time he pets him. -1
B : That's terrible. -1
A : When Steven was a baby, we didn't know he was allergic. But now he's crawling around and playing with Buster. His symptoms get really bad. -1
B : I'm so sorry to hear that. You and Charlie have had Buster since he was a puppy. I remember when all three of you moved in next door. -1
A : I know. We got Buster before our son was born. Charlie is so sad. -1
B : How about your relatives? Are there any family members that could take Buster? Then you can still see him whenever you want. 0
A : I asked my sister and Charlie asked his brothers. But no one is able to take a dog right now. -1
B : Well, our kids are all grown up and living on their own. Stan and I get lonely sometimes. Would you like us to adopt Buster? -1
A : Really? You would do that? 0
B : Stan and I really like Buster. He's housetrained and well-behaved. He rarely barks too. 1
A : Don't you need to talk to Stan first! 1
B : Oh, he'll say yes. He's been talking about getting a dog lately. He'll be happy it's Buster. 1
A : Thank you so much! 1
B : You can come see him anytime. 1
A : You're the best neighbor anyone could have. 1
