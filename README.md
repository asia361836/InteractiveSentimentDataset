# InteractiveSentimentDatset
This is conversational dataset for interactive sentiment analysis.
We manually label 2,214 multi-turn English conversations collected from various websites that provide online communication services. In comparison with existing sentiment datasets, ScenarioSA (1) is no longer limited to one specific domain but covers a wide range of topics and scenarios; (2) describes the interactions between two speakers of each conversation; and (3) reflects the sentimental evolution of each speaker over the course of a conversation.
